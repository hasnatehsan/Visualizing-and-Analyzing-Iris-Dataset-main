Analyzing and Visualizing Iris Dataset
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics. It contains measurements of different features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) for three species of Iris flowers. This project involves loading the dataset, performing basic data analysis, and creating plots to visualize the data.
